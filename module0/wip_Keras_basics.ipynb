    "This simplifies and speeds-up development, reduces the risk of bugs, and generally reduces headache.\n",
    "Another neat benefit is that a lot of best practices (initialization, scoping, etc.) are hard-coded into the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other high-level APIs than Keras, such as \n",
    "[TFLearn](http://tflearn.org/),\n",
    "[tf.learn](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/tflearn) (yes, the names are confusing :( ),\n",
    "[tf.slim](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/slim), and\n",
    "[tf.layers](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers).\n",
    "These are generally intercompatible, and offer overlaping functionality.\n",
    "This can be confusing.\n",
    "In order to simplify things we have chosen to focus on just one: Keras.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Keras](https://keras.io/)**\n",
    "is a high-level API that can use TensorFlow or Theano as backend.\n",
    "In early 2017 [TensorFlow chose Keras](http://www.fast.ai/2017/01/03/keras/) as the first high-level API to include into the tensorflow core (as opposed to contrib).\n",
    "Keras has official Google support and has a large community and pre-existing examples.\n",
    "Making it the best high-level API to learn at the moment (according to the author).\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras sits of top of TFLayers, and shares its implementation (e.g. `tf.layers.dense` and `keras.layers.Dense` are the same).\n",
    "Keras helps with model creation, training, and evaluation.\n",
