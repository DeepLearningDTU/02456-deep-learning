# DTU course 02456 Deep learning v2.0 alpha

## Installation
All exercises are written in Python programming language and formatted into Jupyter Notebooks. In order to run the exercises you must satisfy the below requirements:

**1. Python 3.5**

- We recommend installing via **Anaconda** from [https://www.continuum.io/downloads](https://www.continuum.io/downloads),
as it provides many useful third party libraries. 

- We use `Python 3.5` since it is the only version TensorFlow supports on Windows 
(at least as of May 2017).

**2. TensorFlow 1.1**

- Follow the installation instructions at https://www.tensorflow.org/install/.

- If you have a GPU install the GPU version. This greatly decreases training time.

- The exercises are tested with `TensorFLow 1.1`, but other versions might also work


## Running the Exercises 
The exercises are created as Jupyter Notebooks.

If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter we suggest that you familiarize yourself beginning with the exercises: [quick introduction](https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/basics-jupyter-notebook-and-python), [thorough introduction](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook#gs.a6M6p0Q). But very briefly Jupyter Notebooks are interactive Python environments that allow us to combine documentation (images, text, etc.) with code.

### Acessing the exercises:
1. Download the repository from Github
1. In a terminal/command prompt type: `jupyter notebook` 
    * This should start your default browser and you should be up and running. 
    * **Safari** is known to cause issues, so we recommend that you use the newest version of Chrome.

**TIP**: In the menue bar in the top you can go to `Help >> Keyboard Shortcuts` and see a list of shortcuts.
Here is a convenient shortlist 

| Shortcut        	| Action                                                                                  	|
|-----------------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `CTRL + Enter`  	| Execute current cell                                                                    	|
| `Shift + Enger` 	| Execute current cell, and select to next                                                	|
| `Esc`           	| Leave **edit mode** and enter **command mode**                                          	|
| `a`             	| while in **command** mode: Create new cell above current                                    	|
| `b`             	| while in **command** mode: Create new cell below current                                    	|
| `dd`            	| while in **command** mode: Delete current cell                                              	|
| `ii`            	| while in **command** mode: Interrupt kernel (same as `CTRL + c` when using Python normally) 	|
| `Shift + Tab`   	| while in **edit** mode: Inspect element (useful for **debugging!**)                        	|
| `l`   	 	 	| while in **edit** mode: Display line numblers (useful for **debugging!**)
