    "In this part, we will create an agent that can learn to solve tasks from OpenAI Gym by applying the Policy Gradient method. We will implement the agent with a probabilistic policy, that given a state of the environment, $s$, outputs a probability distribution over available actions, $a$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_\\theta(a|s)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this is a deep learning course, we will model the policy as a neural network with parameters $\\theta$ and train it with gradient descent (now the name 'Policy Gradient' should start to make sense). \n",
    "When the set of available actions is discrete, we can use a network with softmax output. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of training the policy network is simple: *we want to maximize the expected total reward by increasing the probability of good actions and decreasing the probability of bad actions*. \n",

    "We cannot evaluate the average over roll-outs analytically, but we have an environment simulator that when supplied with our current policy $p_\\theta(a|s)$ can return the sequence of action, states and rewards. This allows us to replace the integral by a Monte Carlo average over $V$ roll-outs:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, to reduce the variance of the gradient, instead of $R$, we use the adjusted discounted future reward, also known as the *advantage*, $A$:\n",
