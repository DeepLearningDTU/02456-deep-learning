    "### What is TensorFlow\n",
    "TensorFlow is a programming system in which you represent computations as graphs.\n",
    "This graph is then compiled to efficient C/C++ code.\n",
    "The added layer of abstraction makes TensorFlow very flexible.\n",
    "TensorFlow can be interfaced using different languages, with Python being the most common, and the same code can run seamlessly on different types of hardware (such as GPUs, clusters, or mobile phones).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/tf_overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow provides multiple APIs. \n",
    "The lowest level API, **TensorFlow Core**, provides you with fine-grained control.\n",
    "Higher level APIs, such as `tf.contrib.learn`, are built on top of TensorFlow Core, are generally faster and easier to use.\n",
    "They help manage data, training, and inference.\n",
    "This guide begins with an introduction to **TensorFlow Core**.\n",
    "Later, in other exercises, we will demonstrate how to use Tensorflow in a way that is closer to how it is used in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB**: The part of TensorFlow is listed under `contrib` (short for contribution) are still in development, and their interface may change.\n",
    "The rest of TensorFlow is stable within the major release cycle (e.g. `0.x`, `1.x`, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "To use TensorFlow you need to understand how TensorFlow:\n",
    "* Represents computations as graphs.\n",
    "* Executes graphs in the context of Sessions.\n",
    "* Represents data as tensors.\n",
    "* Uses feeds and fetches to get data into and out of arbitrary operations.\n",

    "The two basic building blocks of TensorFlow are **tensors** and **operations** (called ops for short).\n",

    "    * An op takes zero or more Tensors, performs some computation, and produces zero or more Tensors.\n",
    "* **Tensors**: The edges in the graph\n",
    "    * A Tensor is a typed multi-dimensional array, and are how information flows through the graph.\n",
    "    * Tensors are used for data and parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "A TensorFlow graph is a description of computations.\n",
    "To compute anything, a graph must be launched in a `Session`. \n",
    "A `Session` places the graph ops onto `Devices`, such as CPUs or GPUs, and provides methods to execute them.\n",
