# Lab 1: Dense Feed-Forward Networks

Lab 1 demonstrates how to implement simple neural networks in TensorFlow.
After having completed this lab you should ...
* know how inference and training are performed in neural networks
* know how computaions performed using linear algebra
* be able to use basic TensorFlow functionalities
* be able to setup and train a simple deep learning model

## Notebooks
* `0.Installation_validation`
	* Simple test of whether everything is installed and configured correctly.
* `1.TUT_Introduction_to_TensorFlow`
	* Basic TensorFlow operations, and how to use it for simple computations.
	* Using TensorBoard to visualize the computational graph and the learning process.
	* Simple linear regression example.
* `2.TUT_Introduction_to_Neural_Networks`
	* Shows how to setup and train a neural network model for the **two-moons dataset**.
	* Automatic differentiation
	* Advanced optimizers
* `3.EXE_lab1_FFN_tensorflow_PT2`
	* Develop your own neural network for the **MNIST handwritten digits dataset**.

## Jupyter tips
In the menue bar in the top you can go to `Help >> Keyboard Shortcuts` and see a list of shortcuts.
Here is a convenient shortlist:

| Shortcut        	| Action                                                                                  	|
|-----------------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| `CTRL + Enter`  	| Execute current cell                                                                    	|
| `Shift + Enger` 	| Execute current cell, and select to next                                                	|
| `Esc`           	| Leave **edit mode** and enter **command mode**                                          	|
| `a`             	| while in **command** mode: Create new cell above current                                    	|
| `b`             	| while in **command** mode: Create new cell below current                                    	|
| `dd`            	| while in **command** mode: Delete current cell                                              	|
| `ii`            	| while in **command** mode: Interrupt kernel (same as `CTRL + c` when using Python normally) 	|
| `Shift + Tab`   	| while in **edit** mode: Inspect element (useful for **debugging!**)                        	|
| `l`   	 	 	| while in **edit** mode: Display line numblers (useful for **debugging!**)
