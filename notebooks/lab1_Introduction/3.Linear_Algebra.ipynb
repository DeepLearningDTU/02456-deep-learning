    "\n",
    "In the former notebook we developed a simple toy network with one unit and went manually through backpropagation. It was tedius work with just one unit, to do this manually for more complicated networks would be almost impossible. Luckily for us, almost all the operations needed for propagating the inputs through the neural network and updating the weights afterwards can be calculated efficiently using linear algebra. \n",
    "\n",
    "*N.B is you are not fully comfortable you might want to look at our notebook **OPT_Pure_Python**. Here we build a neural network without the use of Linear Algebra. We also introduce several different activation functions in this notebook. These might be beneficial to get comfortable with*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we are going to use the scientific computing library Numpy to define a more complicated network. We do this to show how much more compact the network can be formulated if we use concepts from linear algebra. \n",
    "When we afterwards use specialized deep learning frameworks to define the networks, it is important to remember that these are based on linear algebra as well, and are doing almost the same as we do here. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest difference is that they include advanced techniques for redundant operations and use the available hardware optimally."
