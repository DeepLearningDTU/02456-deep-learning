    "Pure TF is very verbose, and it is therefore a good idea to use a high-level API of some sort.\n",
    "This simplifies and speeds-up development, reduces the risk of bugs, and generally reduces headache.\n",
    "To handle this complexity various researchers and companies have gone in different directions with their frameworks.\n",
    "Some have made it easier to explicitly state what you want, others have made it easier to quickly iterate over possible network structures.\n",
    "There is no wrong or right here, just different implementations. \n",
    "Another neat benefit is that a lot of best practices (initialization, scoping, etc.) are hard-coded into the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To showcase how different the implementations are, we have included this notebook to showcase **[Keras](https://keras.io/)**.\n",
    "Keras is a high-level API that can use TensorFlow or Theano as backend.\n",
    "It makes it really easy to try various configurations quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "There several other high-level APIs: \n",
    "* [TFLearn](http://tflearn.org/),\n",
    "* [tf.learn](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/tflearn) (yes, the names are confusing :( ),\n",

    "* [tf.layers](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers).\n",

    "This can be confusing.\n",
    "In order to simplify things we have chosen to focus on just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In early 2017 [TensorFlow chose Keras](http://www.fast.ai/2017/01/03/keras/) as the first high-level API to include into the tensorflow core (as opposed to `contrib`).\n",
    "Keras has official Google support and has a large community and pre-existing examples.\n",
    "Making it a good choice for high-level API to learn at the moment.\n",
    "It is built on top of various backends, and can thus be utilized on top of almost all the other frameworks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keras makes it easy to iterate over many standard building blocks, it makes it difficult too try to build new building blocks or experiment with small alterations of the standard building blocks specialized for your particular problem. \n",
    "Keras is however compatible with TF core, so you can easily create custom functionality when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### External resources\n",
    "If you wish to dig deeper into Keras have a look at:\n",
    "* [Keras code](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/keras) in the TF github repo. Looking at the code is often the best way to understand what is going on.

With 4 different ways of describing the same general network architecture, it should be obvious there is no `\"right\"` way to define a neural network. In general the only thing rule of thumb is to not try and implement the networks from scratch. There are numerous frameworks which takes care the fundamental concepts are implemented correctly. In this class we will mostly use Tensorflow and show Keras implementations here and there. However, if these are not of your taste, you can take a look at: \n",
