    "In this notebook we will guide you through building a neural network classifier for the (in)famous MNIST dataset.\n",
    "MNIST is a dataset that is often used for benchmarking, consisting of 70.000 image-label paris of handwritten digits from 0-9.\n",
    "During the notebook we have provided a program skeleton and severalt tips to help guid you through it.\n",
    "Further more the task is quite similar to what you did in the previous notebook, so you should reffer to it in order to remind yourself about the implementation.\n",

    "We will implement a dense feedforward neural network (just like before).\n",
    "In this setting we represent each image as a vector, instead of a 2D map.\n",
    "We therefore lose the spatial information of the images.\n",
    "The ordering of the pixels in the vector does not matter, so we could permutate all images using the same permutation and still get the same performance.\n",
    "This task is therefore called the _permutation invariant_ MNIST.\n",
    "Obviously this throws away a lot of structure in the data that could have been used.\n",
    "Later we will see how spatial information can be included, by using the convolutional neural network architecture.\n",

    "In this exercise we want you to get some experience with setting up training for yourself, and we therefore want you to implement the training loop yourself.\n",

    "The `Sequential` model, or built in layers, such as `keras.layers.Dense` are allowed, as long as you define the training ops and training loop yourself.\n",
    "(If are having problems using `keras.layers` have a look at the [Keras as a simplified interface to TensorFlow](https://blog.keras.io/keras-as-a-simplified-interface-to-tensorflow-tutorial.html) tutorial).\n"
