    "This is because all other parts of deep learning is simply mulitplying weights to the input which is a linear function.\n",
    "Without a non-liniear activation function any network regardless of its size or shape would thus only be able to represent linear functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation functions are still a hot research topic and new activation functions appear regularly.\n",
    "However, there are a few which have been proven to work over and over again.\n",
    "Of these Sigmoid and TanH are the most classical choices, and was the preffered activation functions for many years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recently the trend is moving towards more minimalistic activation functions which generally only differ from linear functions when the input is less than zero.\n",
    "In theory any non-linear function can be used as long as its derivative can be computed efficiently.\n",
    "However, in practice the functions shown below tend to do very well, and one should have a really good reason to try and come up with a new activation function instead of just using one of the existing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below several common nonliear activation functions are implemented and described.\n",
    "Remember to use the TensorFlow implemention in your code, NOT the implementaions below!\n",
