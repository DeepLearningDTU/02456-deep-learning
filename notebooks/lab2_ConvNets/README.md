# Lab 2: Convolutional Neural Networks

Lab 2 introduces Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). 
After having completed this lab you should ...
* know how the basic operations are computed
	* Convolution
	* Pooling
* know how to implement a convolutional layer using TensorFlow


## Notebooks
* `1.Introduction_to_ConvNets`
	* Introduction to the basic concepts.
	* Optional visualization of convolutional filter, i.e. what does a ConvNet 'see'.
* `2.OPT_Convolutional_arithmetics`
	* OPTIONAL: Advanced in depth coverage of how ConvNets work.
* `3.EXE_MNIST_with_ConvNets`
	* Exercise where you solve the MNIST data set with Convnets
* `4.OPT_Spatial_Transformer_Networks`
	* OPTIONAL: Demonstration of a cool application of ConvNet: 
	Training ConvNets to zoom in on the relevant parts of a problem.
