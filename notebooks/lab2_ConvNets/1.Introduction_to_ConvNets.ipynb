    "## What are convolutional networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "ConvNets are in may respects very similar to the dense feedforward networks we saw previously:\n",
    " * The network is still organized into layers\n",
    " * Each layer is parameterized by weights and biases\n",
    " * Each layer has an element-wise non-linear transformation (activation function)\n",
    " * There are no cycles in the connections (more on this in later labs)\n",
    "\n",
    "*So what is the difference?*\n",
    "The networks we saw previously are called *dense* because each unit receives input from all the units in the previous layer.\n",
    "This is not the case for ConvNets.\n",
    "In ConvNets each unit is only connected to a small subset of the input units.\n",
    "This is called the *receptive field* of the unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let us look at a quick example.\n",
    "Let us define a `3x3` window with the kernel weights (indicated by red in the bottom right).\n",
    "We apply the window by performning elementwise multiplication, and then summing the results, as shown in this animation:\n",

    "### Strides, padding, and pooling\n",
    "\n",
    "Two important concepts for ConvNets are *strides* and *padding*.\n",
    "#### Padding\n",
    "describes what we do at the edges of the feature map.\n",
    "If we don't use padding the feature map will get smaller every time, as we can see above. \n",
    "If we do use padding we can maintain the same resolution. \n",

    "#### Pooling\n",
    "is another method for reducing the spatial resolution. Similar to convolutional layers it works by sliding a window accross the feature map. Unlike the convolutional layers there are no learnable parameters, and the pooling layers perform the same simple operation every time. The most common types of pooling are:\n",
    " * *Max pooling* where the output of the pooling operation is the highest value in the window, and\n",
    " * *Mean pooling* which outputs the mean of the elements in the window.\n",
