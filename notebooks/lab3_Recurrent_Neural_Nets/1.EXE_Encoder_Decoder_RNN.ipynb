    "## Encoder-Decoder\n",
    "In this exercise we'll implement a Encoder-Decoder RNN based for a simple sequence to sequence translation task.\n",
    "We will use a special kind of unit, called the GRU unit.\n",
    "The GRU unit stores a hidden value per neuron that helps it '*remember*' long-term dependencies.\n",
    "Another popular choice are LSTMs, which store two values, but these are approximately twice as slow as GRU.\n",
    "GRUs (and LSTMs) are difficult to understand.\n",
    "For a very good not-to-mathematical introduction see \n",
    "[Chris Olahs blog](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) or\n",
    "[Andrej Karpathys blog](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)\n",
    "(All their posts are nice and cover various topics within machine-learning).\n",
    "This type of models have shown impressive performance in Neural Machine Translation and Image Caption generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the encoder-decoder structure one RNN (blue) encodes the input into a hidden representation, and a second RNN (red) uses this encoding to predict the target values.\n",
    "An essential step is deciding how the encoder and decoder should communicate.\n",
    "In the simplest approach you use the last hidden state of the encoder to initialize the decoder.\n",
    "This is what we will do in this notebook, as shown here:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/enc-dec.png', width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Teacher forcing\n",
    "We will also use a trick called _teacher forcing_ and that helps RNNs train faster.\n",
    "The goal is to have the decoder predict the entire output sequence on its own.\n",
    "However if a prediction in a sequence is wrong it is likely that the following predictions will also be wrong as the output at one timestep is used to predict the next (gray lines in the figure).\n",
    "This slows learning, as the errors made after the first one aren't very informative.\n",
    "In order to aliviate this we, at training time, feed the correct targets instead of the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternatives\n",
    "There are other ways to let the encoder and decoder communicate with each other.\n",
    "For instance you can give the last state of the Encoder as input to the Decoder at each decode time step, not just the previously predicted word.\n",
    "Another approache is called **attention**, which lets the Decoder attend to different parts of the encoded input at different timesteps in the decoding process. \n",
    "Attention is shown in the next notebook. \n",

    "### The Data\n",
