Since then Google have sponsored its expansion and now the prizes of the competitions and the amount of public datasets are bigger than ever. Most competitions on Kaggle have a dataset, an accuracy metric and a leaderboard to compare submissions.\n",

Three sets of features are also provided per image: a shape contiguous descriptor, an interior texture histogram, and a ﬁne-scale margin histogram. For each feature, a 64-attribute vector is given per leaf sample.\n",
